# Cash-Management-System
This Java project demonstrates my skills in object-oriented programming, data handling, and user interaction. It simulates a cash management system, tracking quantities of notes and coins, calculating total value and weight, and dispensing the correct denominations for transactions, showcasing my problem-solving and real-world logic implementation.
